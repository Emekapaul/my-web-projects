        <p>my name is ugwuoke paul Nnaemeka, i am 26 years old. I am a graduate of psychlogy from the university of ibadan, Nigeria.
        I started my journey as a web developer a year ago. I picked interest in web development because i have always been interested in how things work,
        How are the things that show up in the internet work, How did it come to be and what made it possible. It is more of like a passion for me.
        </p>

        <p>The road to becoming a web developer has not been easy. What i have been doing mostly is self learning. I source for materials and resources in the web and use it to practice and teach myself.
        It has not been easy because i have been the one teaching myself but i look forward to finding an organisation where i can learn and upgrade my skills
        </p>

        <p>This is a website i created to show projects i have done so far in the journey of becoming a web developer, Projects that i am currently doing and projects 
        that i plan to do in the future. With time as i upgrade my skills this website will be updated to show projects i have completed, 
        projects i am currently working on and projects i plan to work on in the future.
